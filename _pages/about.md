I am currently on the 2025 job market. Please contact me if you would like to discuss potential openings or collaborations!

# About me

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (UofT), advised by Prof. [Stark C. Draper](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/draper-s/) through both Ph.D. and MASc. programs. I work at the intersection of **distributed systems**, **machine learning**, and **data privacy**, with a focus on making distributed ML systems more robust against delays (stragglers) and more privacy-aware in settings like *federated learning*. 
I use tools and ideas from *error-correction codes*, *randomized*, *numerically stable* algorithms, and *differential privacy* (e.g., via the *PyTorch-friendly* library Opacus) to build reliable and trustworthy ML systems, tested on real-world platforms like *Amazon EC2* and *Canada's SciNet* HPC cluster.

My work has been recognized and generously supported by over 15 scholarships and awards, including but not limited to the NSERC CGS D3, DiDi graduate award, Ontario Graduate Scholarship, and MITACS Globalink Research Award.

Along the way, I've explored industry and academic collaborations through internships at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://sprintml.com/) (Spring 2024), Huawei Accelerated Neural Technology team (Summer 2021), and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Summer 2015).
I've also been certified by the [International HPC Summer School, Japan 2019](https://ss19.ihpcss.org/), and [North American School of Information Theory, USA 2023](https://nasit.seas.upenn.edu/). Prior to graduate studies, I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).


Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, cooking and testing new dishes, gardening, and trying to win at backgammon or other strategic games.
