## Welcome!
I am a researcher and quantitative engineer who enjoys creating novel solutions for big data and machine learning problems while exploring diverse research topics, transferring ideas across domains, and ensuring practical effectiveness.

**I am currently on the 2025 job market. Please contact me if you would like to discuss potential openings or collaborations!**

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experiences
* **Graduate Researcher at UofT**: I built personalized and group-wise differentially private federated learning algorithms to meet heterogeneous privacy and trust requirements, and engineered fault-tolerant systems to mitigate stragglers.
* **Privacy Research Scientist Intern at CISPA**: I designed time-adaptive, personalized privacy budget mechanisms to enhance federated learning performance under anonymization constraints.
* **Machine Learning Research Associate Intern at Huawei**: I developed quantization error bounds to optimize hardware-aware training of deep neural networks.
* **Information Theory Research Intern at CUHK**: I explored fundamental problems in network information theory to model capacity regions and reliability trade-offs in communication channels.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Background

I earned my Ph.D. and MASc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of Toronto**, advised by Prof. Stark C. Draper, working on the intersection of distributed systems, machine learning, and data privacy. Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (digital systems) with a minor in Economics at the **Sharif University of Technology**.

## ðŸ”¬ Areas of Expertise

My work spans:

* **Privacy in Machine Learning**: I developed differentially private training methods and implemented them in Python using Opacus. 
* **Optimization**: I tuned algorithm parameters and analyzed convergence of training algorithms under privacy and utility constraints.
* **Federated Machine Learning**: My research pioneered the design of private grouped federated learning under personalization constraints.
* **Algorithm Design**: I designed randomized, numerically stable, and approximate algorithms for mitigating straggler issue in distributed systems.
* **Error-Correction Codes**: I applied using polynomial coding and interpolation to introduce efficient redundancy and address stragglers in distributed computing.
* **Quantization in Machine Learning**: I analyzed the error of using reduced-precision weights and activations to balance accuracy with faster computation and lower memory usage.
* **Implementation**: I implemented our differentially private learning solutions in Python using PyTorch and Opacus, and evaluated our straggler-resilient methods on Amazon EC2 and Canada's SciNet HPC cluster using Python and mpi4py.

## Personal

Outside of research, I enjoy practicing creativity through cooking and experimenting with new dishes, hiking new trails, and trying to win at backgammon or other strategic games. When I'm not lazy, I spend time gardening. Whenever possible, I travel to explore new cultures.
