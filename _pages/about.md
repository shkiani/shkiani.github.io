My name is Shahrzad and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (UofT). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Stark C. Draper](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/draper-s/) during both my Ph.D. and MASc. studies. Before coming to UofT, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and a minor degree in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).

I spent spring 2024 as a research intern at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security (Granted with Mitacs Globalink Research Award Abroad), summer 2021 as a research intern at Huawei Accelerated Neural Technology (Ant) team, and summer 2015 as an undergraduate intern at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
I also certified at [International High-Performance Computing Summer School (IHPCSS), Japan 2019](https://ss19.ihpcss.org/), and [North American School of Information Theory (NASIT), USA 2023](https://nasit.seas.upenn.edu/).
# Research

My research focus lies in the span of *Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Learning*, *Coding theory*, *Statistics*, and *Data privacy*.  I work toward exploring the intricacies of distributed computing, seeking innovative techniques to enhance the straggling and adversary tolerance of large-scale data processing across distributed systems. In particular, a part of my research delves into the realm of coding theory, focusing on the development of coding schemes that mitigate straggler effects in distributed computing. Furthermore, I have investigated approximated and statistical computing, devising novel algorithms to combine with coded computing to further accelerate computation. My research has recently extended to data privacy, where I explore differential privacy techniques for protecting sensitive information while still allowing meaningful analysis, addressing challenges such as privacy-aware federated learning. 

My research is currently supported by the NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral (CGS D3) as well as by the UofT's student and research fellowship. I have also been the recipient of the DiDi graduate award for four consecutive years and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship for two consecutive years.
