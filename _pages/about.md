I am currently on the 2025 job market, so please reach out if you know of a good opportunity!

# About me

I am a Ph.D. researcher and engineer working at the intersection of *distributed systems*, *machine learning*, and *data privacy*. I have dedicated much of my work to enhancing the reliability of large-scale ML-driven distributed systems by making them more robust against delays (stragglers) and adaptable to diverse, sometimes conflicting, privacy requirements. 
I draw on tools from *error-correction coding* as well as *approximate*, *randomized*, and *numerically stable* algorithms to design our **straggler-resilient distributed optimization** methods. I validate our methods on real-world platforms like *Amazon EC2* and *Canada's SciNet* HPC cluster. I also explore *differential privacy* techniques and use *PyTorch-friendly* libraries such as Opacus to test our **privacy-preserving federated learning** methods.

My research has been recognized and generously supported by over 15 scholarships and grants, including but not limited to the NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship-Doctoral (CGS D3), DiDi graduate award, Ontario Graduate Scholarship, and MITACS Globalink Research Award.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (UofT), and will soon be awarded my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Stark C. Draper](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/draper-s/) through both my Ph.D. and MASc. studies and to collaborate with many world-class researchers and mentors along the way. Before joining UofT, I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).
I also explored industry and academic collaborations through internships at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://sprintml.com/) (Spring 2024), Huawei Accelerated Neural Technology team (Summer 2021), and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Summer 2015).
Additionally, I was certified by the [International High-Performance Computing Summer School (IHPCSS), Japan 2019](https://ss19.ihpcss.org/), and the [North American School of Information Theory (NASIT), USA 2023](https://nasit.seas.upenn.edu/).
