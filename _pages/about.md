I am currently on the 2025 job market. Please contact me if you would like to discuss potential openings or collaborations!

# About me

I am a Ph.D. researcher and engineer at the intersection of *distributed systems*, *machine learning*, and *data privacy*, where ML meets massive distributed systems and we try to make things smarter and more trustworthy. I am especially into making ML systems more robust against delays (stragglers) and more privacy-aware in settings like *federated learning*. 
I use tools like *error-correction codes* and *randomized*, *numerically stable* algorithms to design our **straggler-resilient distributed optimization** methods, validated on *Amazon EC2* and *Canada's SciNet* HPC cluster. I also explore *differential privacy* techniques and use *PyTorch-friendly* libraries such as Opacus to build and test our **privacy-preserving federated learning** systems.

My research has been recognized and generously supported by over 15 scholarships and awards, including but not limited to the NSERC CGS D3, DiDi graduate award, Ontario Graduate Scholarship, and MITACS Globalink Research Award.

Currently, I am completing my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (UofT), where I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Stark C. Draper](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/draper-s/) through my Ph.D. and MASc. journeys. Before joining UofT, I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Economics from the [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).
Along the way, I've explored industry and academic collaborations through internships at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://sprintml.com/) (Spring 2024), Huawei Accelerated Neural Technology team (Summer 2021), and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Summer 2015).
I've also been certified by the [International HPC Summer School, Japan 2019](https://ss19.ihpcss.org/), and [North American School of Information Theory, USA 2023](https://nasit.seas.upenn.edu/).

When I'm not debugging code, developing research ideas, or writing papers, you will probably find me hiking somewhere in nature, cooking and testing new dishes, gardening, or trying to win at backgammon or other strategic board games.
